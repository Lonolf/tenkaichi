It is with big joy that I present you the new app to manage your tournaments, realized with the assistance of the [Sword Academy](https://sword.academy) of Como, Italy.

With action button:

- Save the action with the central button

Without action button
- Insert the number of points for every contender with the plus (+) and minus (-)

- When terminating a match, the programm will calculate if a new match is necessary, or if the game is finished

- Matches per game: The software will determine the winner of a game on a basis of a "best of" rule: if one of the contender have win the half + 1 of the number of matches per game, the game is considered finished. If, at the end of the last match, no contender have win the half + 1 number of matches, the game is considered a draw.
